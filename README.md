## Major Milestones ##

### Journaling ###

Users will be in a position to input occurrences of each day, based on their mood, keep track of the inputs but will not be able to update or change them.

### Anonymous peer support ###

Based on the users' mental problems, the system will connect users with other users (anonymously) where they will chat in real-time, share experiences, and offer or receive any advice.

### Resource Recommendations ###

Besides having a listening ear, patients ought to be empathized with, not just sympathized with. A user will be able to receive information about any necessary medical resources - hospitals, articles, therapists where they can further get the support needed.

### Mood tracking ###

Based on user input, users will receive a message informing them about their mood and valuable insights into their emotional well-being.
